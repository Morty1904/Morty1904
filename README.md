##  About me

*  I’m a young 20-year-old rookie who looks forward to learning new things every day.
*  I’m currently attending a bootcamp with FACTORIAF5, learning all about Backend development.
*  Much of my knowledge so far comes from self-learning through videos and practice, at least for now.
*  In my free time, I usually play rhythm games because there’s always room for improvement, and even the best players can keep getting better. I also enjoy learning new things about programming, especially when I’m bored, and I find it enjoyable most of the time (though it wasn’t always fun).

## My Stacks

*  I have basic knowledge of Java, Python, C++, C, R, Kali Linux (which I study using a VM), and a bit of LUA, though I still have much to learn about each of them.
*  I have a strong command of English, approximately at a C1 level, although it is uncertified and based on my self-assessment (but I’m quite confident in it). In my opinion, my biggest issue is not having a strong enough vocabulary, whether in speaking or writing. I also still make basic writing mistakes from time to time.

## Contact

*  My email is oscarendercraft@gmail.com, and I check my inbox daily, so that’s the best way to get in touch. You can also check out my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/osc_mbr/) where you can PM me as an additional way to contact me!
