##  About me

*  I’m a young 20-year-old rookie who looks forward to learn new stuff every day.
*  I've attended a bootcamp with FACTORIAF5, learning all about Backend development.
*  Much of my knowledge so far comes from self-learning through videos and practice in websites like "freecodecamp" (even nowadays).

## My Stacks

*  I have good knowledge of Java, i know the basics of Python, and i learned for a month about kali linux (which I studied using a VM), and now im learning Lua by making my own "Roblox" game and html by making my parents a Web page for their cafe.
*  I have a strong command of English, i put myself at a really high B2, although it is uncertified, [this might further convince you](https://cert.efset.org/en/5Ss2Uj). In my opinion, my biggest issue is not having a strong enough vocabulary, whether in speaking or writing. I also still make basic writing mistakes from time to time.
*  I also have a basic A2 level of Japanese which im learning nowadays in a classroom named "Inari Gakuen".
