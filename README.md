##  About me:

*  I`m a Joung 20 year old rookie that looks forward for learning new stuff every day
*  Iâ€™m currently on a bootcamp with FACTORIAF5 learning all about _Backend.._
*  All my learnings are from self-learning by watching videos and practice at least for now
*  I have basic knowledge about Java, Phython, C++, C, R, Kali Linux (i study this one with a VM) and a bit of LUA but still have much to learn about everyone metioned
* ðŸ˜…How to reach me: My email is _oscarendercraft@gmail.com_, i look for emails every day so that is the best way to reach me. Also check out my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/osc_mbr/), you may 'PM' me there as an additional way of reaching out!
*  I have a strong command of English, approximately at a C1-C2 level, though it is currently uncertified and it is just a self-evaluation of my own skills(although I'm quite certain about it).
*  On my free time i usually play rhythm games because there is always room to improve and even the best players have room to improve. I generally like to learn new things about programming, specially when im bored and i enjoy learning most of the time (it wasn`t always funðŸ˜°..)
